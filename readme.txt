<!-- About Section Content-->
I am an upcoming Data Analyst with some experience in Quality Assurance, UI/UX design, Web Development, and Graphic Design. My current strengths lies in Excel, MySQL Workbench, and Power BI, but I'm also familiar with Tableau, R, and Python.

I also like to draw and am comfortable with using various art programs, such as Clip Studio Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, and of course good ol' MS Paint. This skill has came in handy for UI/UX design where I was able to quickly and easily create mock-up pages for the developers to reference of varying levels of detail.
